Odisha River Basins Map

This project visualizes the major river basins of Odisha using thematic mapping techniques in GIS.

Project Description

The map illustrates various river basins across the state of Odisha, each represented by distinct colors and labeled with basin names. This thematic representation helps in understanding the hydrological divisions of the region.

 Features

Digitized river basin boundaries

Clear legend indicating river basin names

Drainage network overlay

Scale bar and north arrow for reference

Thematic coloring for easy distinction


Tools & Techniques Used

QGIS – For map digitization and cartographic styling

Georeferencing – To align basemap with coordinates

Polygon Digitization – For creating basin boundaries

Symbology – Color-coded basins for easy visualization

Layout Manager – For map elements like legend, north arrow, and scale
